# Self Hosting a Caching / Authoritative Internal DNS Sever

## What is DNS

DNS (Domain Name Services) is a distributed approach to mapping hosts/domains to IP address.
The traditional analogy is the classic, long forgotten, phone book. You know your friend's name (host/domain), but it's hard to remember phone numbers (IP Address). DNS solves that issue. It also distributes the information and management.

## Why you might want or need DNS

Sometimes our internal/home networks become large and complex. Editing local host files on each and every machine can start to take more time, and we might forget to update a single machine. A good solution would be to centralise this information. Enter DNS.

## The guides
- BIND
    - [Debian (Stretch / Buster)](debian-bind.md)
